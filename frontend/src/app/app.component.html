RouterOutlet DIRECTIVE
Acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on 
the current router state.
The <router-outlet> tells the router where to display routed views.
The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became 
available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports 
AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.
